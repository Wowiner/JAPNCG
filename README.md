# JAPNCG
Just Another Python Nitro Code Generator - a simple nitro code generator built in python without any dependencies. 

Tested in Python 3.9.7

**Disclaimer:** The chance to generate a valid code using random characters is very slim, so don't expect to actually get a working code.
## Usage
The script asks you to input the amount of codes you want to generate and then writes them to a file called codes.txt.
